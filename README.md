# To-Do List Application

This project is a simple yet powerful To-Do List Application built using ReactJS. It helps users manage daily tasks efficiently by allowing them to create, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. The app ensures a seamless user experience with state management handled through the Context API, and data persistence achieved using local storage.

# Features:-

* Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
* Mark as Completed: Easily mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
* Local Storage Support: Tasks are saved in the browser’s local storage, so they remain even after a page refresh or browser restart.
* Context API Integration: State is efficiently managed using React’s Context API, ensuring the app is scalable and maintainable.

# Tech Stack :-

* ReactJS: Frontend framework used for building the user interface.
* Context API: For state management, making it easy to share data across components without prop drilling.
* Local Storage: For saving tasks in the browser, allowing persistence of data even after the page is closed or refreshed.
